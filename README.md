# hello-world

Implement the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).  Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden.

The code must be uploaded to the portal and GitHub and be in Python Notebook format (.ipynb file). The GitHub link is to be attached. The repository has to be open.

Evaluation will be done on the code formatting, the final accuracy results, and small explanations of any data preprocessing done (data preprocessing and visualization has bonus points). The explanations must also be included in the same python notebook which can be done using markdown cells.

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
